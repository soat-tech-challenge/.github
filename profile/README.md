## FIAP Pós Tech - Software Architecture - Tech Challenge 
Repositories for the "Tech Challenge" group project (2023 SOAT1 Group 63) from FIAP Pós Tech's Software Architecture course.

### Phases

The project is divided in several 'phases' each one covering some software architecture-related topics.
Some of these topics required code rewriting, refactoring and repository splitting.

Therefore there are releases in each repo for each Phase they were relevant and what topics were covered in them.
